# RFP

RFP is a software that allows you to handle, visualize and analyze microwave resonances. The software can fit resonances in notch-type resonators (i.e coupled to a transmission line). Sofware also allows to analize data from Sonnet simulations and to get the compensated field out of hall bar measurements.
