    "\n",
    "The fitting function was taken from the following paper [Efficient and robust analysis of complex scattering data under noise in microwave resonators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3365), takes into account the environment contribution in the $S_{21}$ parameter and the coupling between the resonator and the transmission line. The fitting function is the following:\n",
    "$$S_{21}^{\\text{notch}}(f)=a e^{i\\alpha} e^{-2\\pi if\\tau}\\left[1-\\frac{\\frac{Q_l}{|Q_e|}e^{i\\phi}}{1+2iQ_l(f/f_0-1)}\\right]$$\n",
    "where $a$ is the amplitude, $\\alpha$ is the phase, $\\tau$ is the delay, $f_0$ is the resonant frequency, $Q_l$ is the total quality factor ($Q_l^{-1}=Q_i^{-1}+\\text{Re}[Q_e{^-1}]$), $Q_e$ is the external quality factor. \n",
    "If we focus the term in bracket, and try to plot real and imaginary part we will have a perfect circle of radius $Q_l/|Q_c|$ with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"fit_b.png\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- The circle always intersects the real axis at 1\n",
    "for $f → \\infty$ independent of the other parameters\n",
    "- Resonance $f = f_0$ is always located at the opposite side. \n",
    "- A tilt by φ indicates an impedance mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plot $\\text{Re}[S_{21}]$ vs $\\text{Im}[S_{21}]$ parameter of some experimental data we will have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"fit_a.png\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    " where the cable delay $\\tau$ causes a circular distortion of the ideal resonance circle.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"fit_c.png\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    " The radius $a$ represents the system's attenuation/gain and the phase $\\alpha$ is the phase of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basing on this, the fitting function is implemented in the code provided in the paper, and roughly speaking, it does the following:\n",
    "1. Estimate the cable delay by fitting a linear function to the phase signal, which tilts the phase by 2πτ.\n",
    "2. Perform a non-linear least square fit on the deformed circle-like curve caused by the cable delay.\n",
    "3. Determine the cable delay ($\\tau$) by minimizing the deviation from the ideal circular shape using the algebraic circle fit.\n",
    "4. Apply an affine transformation ($ae^{i\\alpha}$) to modify the S21 data to resemble a circle, accounting for additional attenuation/amplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Determine the off-resonant point ($P$) as an invariant quantity by fitting a circle to the data, getting $(x_c,y_c)$ and $r_0$. \n",
    "6. After that we translate its center to the origin and we perform a phase vs. frequency fit to obtain the resonance frequency $f_0$, total quality factor ($Q_l$), and offset phase ($\\theta_0$): $\\theta (f)=\\theta_0 +2 \\text{arctan}\\left(2Q_r\\left[1-f/f_0\\right]\\right)$. Then the complex position of the transformed off-resonant point $P'$ is given by: $P'=x_c+r_0 \\text{cos}(\\beta)+i[yc+r_0\\text{sin}(\\beta)]$, here $\\beta=(\\theta_0+\\pi) \\text{ mod } \\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use geometric relations to find the complex position of the transformed off-resonant point ($P'$) and determine the amplitude scaling factor ($a$) and phase offset ($\\alpha$). \n",
    "\n",
    "8. We also calculate $\\phi_0=-\\text{-arcsin}(y_c/r_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. We calculate $Q_c=Q_l/(2 r_0 \\text{exp}(-i\\phi_o))$. With $Q_l$ and $Q_c$, calculate the $Q_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps allow for the characterization of the resonance and the determination of relevant parameters using the provided data. For the fitting to a circle, they present and algebraic method for fitting.\n",
